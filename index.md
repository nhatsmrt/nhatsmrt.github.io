# Introduction
I am Nhat Pham, an aspiring computer scientist and machine learning enthusiast. Currently, I am a student at Universtiy of Washington. My main interest is applying machine learning to real world applications.
<br />
Here, you can find some of my most recent works and projects.
# Awards and Competitions
## AIVIVN Sentiment Analysis Competition
My team won a Vietnamese sentiment analysis competition, using an ensemble of 1D Convolutional Neural Network, Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network, and Self-Attention Recurrent Neural Network.
Our solution (in Vietnamese) can be found here: [Solution](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/AIVIVN_1/blob/master/1st%20place%20solution.md)

# Projects:
## Denoising "Dirty" Documents
This project is based on a Kaggle competition. We apply a Convolutional Neural Network to "clean up" images of documents affected by noises (e.g coffee stains).

## Detecting Insults in Social Commentary
This project is based on a Kaggle competition. I implemented a Recurrent Neural Network using Keras to detect whether a comment is an insult.
