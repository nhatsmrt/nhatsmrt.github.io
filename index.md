# Introduction
I am Nhat Pham, an aspiring computer scientist, a machine learning enthusiast, and a functional programmer. Currently, I am a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Software Engineering Intern at Verta.AI. Previously, I was a Data Science and Statistic student at the University of Washington, Seattle.

My main interest is building functional, scalable, data-driven machine learning applications. You can find my CV [here](CV.pdf), my UW transcript [here](UWUnofficialTranscript.pdf), and my UMD transcript [here](Testudo%20-%20Unofficial%20Transcript.pdf).

Below is a summary of some of my most recent works and projects.

# Awards and Competitions
## AIVIVN Sentiment Analysis Competition
My team won a Vietnamese sentiment analysis competition, using an ensemble of 1D Convolutional Neural Network, Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network, and Self-Attention Recurrent Neural Network.

Our solution (in Vietnamese) can be found [here](https://github.com/petrpan26/Aivivn_1/blob/master/1st%20place%20solution.md).

GitHub Repository: [AIVIVN_1](https://github.com/petrpan26/Aivivn_1)
## Emotion Recognition Competition
My team placed 8th in the public round of an emotion recognition based on audio, using a convolutional neural network on top of MFCC representation.

# Work Experience
## Software Engineering Intern at Verta (June-November 2020)
At Verta, I was fortunate enough to have worked on many parts of the company's tech stack:
* I implemented the dataset versioning interface for Verta's Scala client, inspired by GitHub's design, with immutable datatypes (Repository, Commit) and operations (update, revert, merge).
* I worked on the new machine learning model registry and deployment interface for Verta's Python client, wrote a command-line tool that helps user to automate their deployment workflow, and maintained the deployment backend, written in Golang and MySQL. I also wrote end-to-end deployment tests to prevent regression.
* I set up the Jenkins test pipeline for the Scala client, and configured a Kubernetes pods for the pipeline to run on.

# Personal Projects:
## Machine Learning:
### Neural Network Toolbox
Whenever I do a project, I always have to re-implement everything from scratch. At first, this is helpful because it requires me to really learn the concepts and procedures by heart. However, these chores quickly become irritating and annoying. So I start to create this repository, to store all the useful pieces of code.

GitHub Repository: [nn-toolbox](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/nn-toolbox)
### Arbitrary Style Transfer
I implement a neural network that can transfer the style of an arbitrary drawing to another arbitrary photo.
<br />
GitHub Repository: [torch-styletransfer](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/torch-styletransfer)
### Denoising "Dirty" Documents
This project is based on a Kaggle competition. We apply a Convolutional Neural Network to "clean up" images of documents affected by noises (e.g coffee stains).

### Detecting Insults in Social Commentary
This project is based on a Kaggle competition. I implemented a Recurrent Neural Network using Keras to detect whether a comment is an insult.

GitHub Repository: [DetectingInsults](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/DetectingInsults)
## Web Programming and Visualization:
### PumpItUp Visualization
Based on the data of a [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), I have created a simple interactive map visualization of wells (functional and otherwise) in Tanzania, using the shiny and leaflet packages in R. You can see it [here](https://nphamcs.shinyapps.io/PumpItUp/).
<!-- ### Personal Finance Web Application
I got fed up with overspending my money, so I decided to create a simple web application with React and Dexie to keep track of my spending. I plan to expand the application as my needs arise, but for now I have deployed and hosted it on my github page.

# Other Work:
## fp-course
GitHub Repository: [fp-course](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/fp-course)
<br />
My solution to exercises of fp-course, an introductory course on functional programming concepts in Haskell.
## lets-lens
GitHub Repository: [lets-lens](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/lets-lens)
<br />
My solution to exercises of lets-lens, a course on optics (functional data accessors and modifiers) in Haskell.
## Data Structures and Algorithms Practice:
GitHub Repository: [AlgorithmPractice](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/AlgorithmPractice)
<br />
This is where I store my data structures and algorithms practice, usually in the form of solutions to LeetCode problems.
## Database Practice:
GitHub Repository: [DatabasePractice](https://github.com/nhatsmrt/DatabasePractice)
<br />
This is where I store my database queries practice.
